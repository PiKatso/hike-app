# _Hike App_

#### _Application for finding Oregon hikes. Built with Ruby, 12 May 2017_

#### _By: **Aubrey Masten, Ben Williams, Kai deRochemont, Kat Gifford, Tyler Stephenson**_

## Description

This project was created at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/) in 3.5 days for a group project. Built after the fourth week of classes in **Ruby** to demonstrate an understanding of PostgreSQL databases, [Active Record](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activerecord) and many-to-many database relationships. All back-end behaviors were tested using RSpec and all front-end behaviors using RSpec and Capybara. The front end was built using Sinatra. It allows a user to create search for and access hikes in Oregon based on specific criteria. This project uses information sourced from [OregonHikers.org](http://www.oregonhikers.org/).

## Database Installation

This program depends on a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (Postgres) database to store information. Set up the database using the information below before running the program. These instructions were tested using macOS, and require you to have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed. Once you have done that, you can find [detailed instructions here](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/ruby/ruby-database-basics/installing-postgres-7fb0cff7-a0f5-4b61-a0db-8a928b9f67ef). Postgres installation is fairly straightforward on Windows machines, you can find a link to an installer [here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads#windows).

* Install Homebrew (macOS only)
* Install PostgreSQL
* Start Postgres server
  * macOS: in a shell run the command `postgres`

## Database Setup

This program relies on a specific database naming conventions. The creation of these databases can be done using the rake gem. Once you have the repository on your computer (instructions below), run the command `bundle install` to install all necessary ruby gems. Then, in your shell, run the following commands to get your database up and running.

  * `rake db:create`
  * `rake db:schema:load`
  * `rake db:seed`

All unit and integration tests currently rely on a secondary development database named `hike_app_test`. If you would like to see unit and integration tests running, run this command to get the test database set up.

 * `rake db:test:prepare`

## Setup/Installation Requirements

To run this site on your own machine you must have Ruby installed. All gems used in the project are included in the `Gemfile`, and the site was tested using the current bundled `Gemfile.lock`.

* Clone this repository in a shell using the command:
`git clone https://github.com/aubreymasten/shoe_stores`
* Follow Database Installation & Setup instructions above
* In the `hike_app` folder run the command `ruby app.rb`
* The site should be available in your browser at `localhost:4567` (the port number (`4567`) may not be accurate on every device. Check your shell, Sinatra should provide you the correct port.)

## Known Bugs

All development and setup instructions were tested on macOS using Ruby version 2.4.1 and ruby 2.3.1.
